LearningJQuery
==============

I was working on learning Ember but realized that my javascript skills weren't as strong. Mainly the logical parts. I want to hammer out two birds with one stone. Firstly I'll focus on improving my raw JS logic and hammer home some of those techniques. Additionally I'm going to pick up JQuery to get more familiar with HTML5/CSS and general DOM manipulation.

I'm using the InfiniteSkills, 2011 video as reference - with other fun stuff sprinkeld in here and there.
